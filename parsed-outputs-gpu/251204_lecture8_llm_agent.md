## Tool Use by Recent LLMs

- Recent LLMs have capability of using tools

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0033/pictures_33.png)

- Page 34 -

## Prompting-base Approach

- One straight forward way for tool-use with LLMs is "in-context learning "
- Example: get weather information[1]

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0035/pictures_35.png)

- Page 36 -

## Prompting-base Approach

- Step #1. Call model with functions defined

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0036/pictures_36.png)

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0036/pictures_37.png)

- Page 37 -

## Prompting-base Approach

- Step #2. Model decides to call function(s)
- Model returns the name and input argument

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0037/pictures_38.png)

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0037/pictures_39.png)

- Page 38 -

## Prompting-base Approach

- Step #3. Execute function code
- Parse the model's response and handle function calls.

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0038/pictures_41.png)

- Page 39 -

## Prompting-base Approach

- Step #4. Supply model with results
- So, model can incorporate them into its final response.

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0039/pictures_43.png)

## Prompting-base Approach

- How it works? "System message "

- Page 42 -

## Prompting-base Approach

- How it works? "System message" + "Detailed description "

- Page 43 -

## Prompting-base Approach

- How it works? "System message" + "Detailed description "
- However, this approach might be suboptimal
- As only relying on implicit in-context learning by LLM (may be only reliable for large LLM)
- When there are tools frequently called and hence should be handling well

- Page 44 -

## Toolformer: Motivation

- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by collecting data is continuously applicable
- Using human annotator or large LLM similar to Self-RAG[1]
- However, it necessarily requires large cost
- Also, it totally relies on intrinsic knowledge of large LLM

- Page 45 -

## Toolformer

- Contribution of Toolformer: Self -supervised learning for tool use
- Self -supervised learning: design task from data without human annotation
- Key idea: Useful tool → Helpful to predict next token

- 𝑎 𝑐 : name of API, 𝑖 𝑐 : corresponding input
- Then, it can be incorporated as text tokens with special tokens "&lt;API&gt;,&lt;/API&gt;,→ "

## ToolLLM: Instruction Generation

- Then, using ChatGPT, generate instruction that requires tool use to answer
- Focus on two aspects: (1) diversity &amp; (2) multi-tool usage
- Prompt is composed of (1) description, (2) documentation for APIs, (3) 3 few-shot data
- 12/36 diverse few -shot examples for single-tool/multi-tool setting (randomly sampled)

- Page 58 -

## ToolLLM: Instruction Generation

- Then, using ChatGPT, generate instruction that requires tool use to answer
- With total API set 𝑆𝐴 𝑆𝐴𝑃𝐼 , at each time, 𝑁 APIs 𝑆𝑁 𝑆𝑁 𝑠𝑢𝑏 = {𝐴𝑃𝐼1 , … , 𝐴𝑃𝐼 𝑁 } are sampled
- Then, generating possible instructions (𝐼𝑛𝑠𝑡 ∗ ) that involve APIs 𝑆 ∗ 𝑠𝑢𝑏 ⊂ 𝑆𝑁 𝑆𝑁 𝑠𝑢𝑏

- After filtering, nearly 200k qualified pairs are collected
- These instruction and relevant API pairs is utilized to train API retriever

## ToolLLM: Solution Path Annotation

- Specifically, function call feature of ChatGPT is utilized
- Namely, sampled APIs 𝑆𝑁 𝑆𝑁 𝑠𝑢𝑏 are fed as available functions (in system message level)
- To let ChatGPT finish an action sequence, two additional functions are defined
- (1) Finish with final answer &amp; (2) Finish by giving up
- Depth first search is considered to efficiently search and collect data

## ToolLLM: Overview

- Overview at inference time (similar to RAG)
- For a given test instruction,
- 1) Retrieving relevant tools &amp; APIs (retrieval of document in RAG)
- 2) With given APIs, generate proper actions of reasoning &amp; API call (generation in RAG)

![Image](251204_lecture8_llm_agent/page_0063/pictures_51.png)

## ToolLLM: Experiment - Retriever

- Dense retriever is trained based on BERT (similar to DPR)
- Query: instruction, Passage: API document
- Positive pair: instruction &amp; relevant API, negative: using API by other instruction
- It even outperforms embedding model (Ada) provided by OpenAI
